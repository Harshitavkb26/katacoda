# Welcome to the kubernetes contribution guide

Welcome to the scenario tho help setting up kubernetes for getting started with upstream contribution!

In this scenario We'll work through the steps to set up kubernetes on a local system(here, Ubuntu) for contributing upstream to k8s, push some changes, and run some common tests to help you understand how the Github Actions CI vets code contributions before allowing them to be accepted for merging.

More details can be found on [kubernetes developer guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/README.md#sig-testing)

Let's jump in! ðŸ¤“
